# Ego-Lane-fitting-Pointclouds

For personal project, I've decided to implement ego-lane polynomial fitting using raw binary files of pointcloud data earned from lidar. 
Along with, Python code, written and tested with Jupyter notebook, I added each part of code as detailed
as possible from data pre-processing to the self-made algorithm to extract polynomial fitting.
